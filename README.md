### More about me:
The reason why I chose electrical engineering is an interesting one. From a young age, I knew that I wanted to be able to design and make things as an engineer. Entering high school,
I realized that I wanted to stay as far away from thermodynamics as possible, turning me away from mechanical engineering. In addition, I picked up programming as a hobby and even though there were plenty of job prospects, I did not want to turn a hobby into a chore. I realized that electrical engineering was the perfect fit because not only did it allow me to still design and make things, but
I would have the opportunity to keep programming without much of the difficult course work (as if electrical engineering was any easier!).
